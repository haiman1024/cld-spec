## 🌍 What is CLD?

A **zero-compromise**, **100% verifiable**, **AI-executable** contract language for defining autonomous causal domains (worlds). (creator language design)

## 🔥 Core Philosophy

- Structure is semantics
- Path is identity
- Reference is graph
- Execution is existence

## 📜 Authority

This repository **IS** the canonical specification. `SPEC.md` is the single source of truth.

## 🛠️ Next Steps

- [ ] Reference Implementation (Rust/Go/TS)
- [ ] CLI Validator
- [ ] VS Code Syntax Highlighting
- [ ] Example Worlds (`mythos`, `spirit`, etc.)

## 🤝 Contribute

We accept **no backward compatibility**. All proposals must align with v9 semantics.
